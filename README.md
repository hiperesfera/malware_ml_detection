# Malware detection using Machine Learning

Features are static objects:
- PE header's data
- CFG signatures

Python modules to extract features:
- pefile: PE header info extraction
- angr: CFG extractor
- r2pipe: radare to the rescue! A python API module
- netLSD: A numeric fingerprint that summarizes the overall structure of a graph. Instead of just saying, “This graph has X nodes and Y edges,” NetLSD simulates a physical process (like heat flow or wave propagation) across the network over time, and then records how that process evolves. The result is a time-series vector that captures the shape or “personality” of the graph. It is nice, isn't it?  Here is the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10712)

Next challenge: how to encode all these features (X) in a 2D matrix, one binary per row being the target (Y) a column with values (0/1)
