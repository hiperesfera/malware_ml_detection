# Malware detection using Machine Learning

Features are static objects:
- PE header's data
- CFG signatures

Python modules to extract features:
- pefile
- angr
- r2pipe

Next challenge: how to encode all these features (X) in a 2D matrix, one binary per row being the target (Y) a column with values (0/1)
